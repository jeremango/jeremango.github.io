### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    All of lab 2 was pretty interesting to me because it was the first lab where I was mostly on my own. In lab 1, the instructions pretty much told me what to input into Visual Studio Code, but in lab 2, it was much more up to me and I had to use my own newfound knowledge for the first time. It was a good first time experience getting into the flow of the class.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because it was interesting seeing the computer quickly compute the amount of days between two dates. I also learned about the Gregorian Calendar and the Julian Calendar. It was interesting seeing the formula that converts a Gregorian Date into a Julian Day, and implement it into my code.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was also a favorite because it was cool making a silly and humorous Mad Lib. I remember playing this game a lot as a child, and it was cool coding it as a program. It was very interesting to learn initializing arguments, and providing a specific amount of them. The fact that the user can enter any types of words can create a huge possibility of funny phrases.
